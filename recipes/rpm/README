The meta-selinux maintainer did a dora release but did not do a daisy release.  There 
no branch that stays with OE daisy.  This causes issues as recipes are added to 
meta-selinux that are only in OE master.  Until moving to the OE master branch this will
be needed here to provide rpm to meta-selinux.  After moving to OE master it can be removed.
